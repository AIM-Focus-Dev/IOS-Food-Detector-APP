# Food Detector Appüçî

## Overview
The Food Detector App is an iOS application built using Swift and Core ML. It uses the device's camera to scan food items and then predicts the type of food using a pre-trained machine learning model with custom layers. 

## Features
- Real-time food detection using the device's camera
- Utilises pytorch model converted to Core ML for efficient and accurate predictions
- Clean and simple user interface
- Easy to set up and run
